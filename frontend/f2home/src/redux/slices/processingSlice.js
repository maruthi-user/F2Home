/**
 * Application-level "processing lock".
 *
 * While `count > 0` the app is considered busy with a write the user must
 * not interfere with (a form submit, an export, an approve/reject) and
 * ProcessingOverlay blocks interaction with the page - the page, not the
 * browser: tabs, the address bar, devtools and browser shortcuts all keep
 * working, only this document stops taking clicks and keys.
 *
 * A counter rather than a boolean so overlapping operations (an export
 * kicked off while a save is still in flight) release in any order without
 * one of them unlocking the page early. `label` is whatever the most recent
 * operation said it was doing; `since` is when the page first locked, which
 * the overlay's watchdog uses to force-release a lock nobody ended.
 *
 * Nothing dispatches these directly except utils/processingLock.js -
 * callers go through runWithProcessingLock so the end is always paired with
 * the begin (finally), even when the work throws.
